# skaphos

*skaphos* is yet another tool to scaffold new projects based a project blueprint which can be stored locally or in a git repository.

It makes use of project [go-archetype](https://github.com/rantav/go-archetype/workflows/Go/badge.svg) to deal with templating.

## Getting started

```bash
go install github.com/bmfs/skaphos
skaphos create github.com/rantav/go-template
```

## Create a template

Check project [go-archetype](https://github.com/rantav/go-archetype/workflows/Go/badge.svg) for more details on how to create templates.
